# Design System

Understand how the design system works

---

## Why use a design system?

A design system is a collection of standards, principles, and guidelines that help you build a consistent user experience.
This library provides a set of components that follow the <span class="underline">[Material Design](https://material.io/design)</span> system, which is a design system created by Google.

<br/>

## Why should you care?

Using a design system inside your project or library not only helps you build a consistent user experience
but also end up with responsive that can be change easily by levering the theme system.

<br/>


## How does it work?

The way this design system works is by utilizing tokens that define the styles of the whole library.
These tokens are used by the components to define their styles, and **by changing the value of these tokens**, you can change the styles of the components.

<br/>

For example, let's modify let's see this button right here:

<br/>

<ChangeThemePanel theme={'colors'} >
    <SchematicButton />
</ChangeThemePanel>

<br/>

## Design system tokens

All of the tokens used by the design system are based on the <span class="underline">[Material Design](https://material.io/design)</span> system,
so you can refer to the Material Design documentation to understand how these tokens work.
<br/>
In the other hand, you can also refer to the <span class="underline">[Theming](/docs/customization)</span> section to understand how to modify these tokens.

<br/>

**IMPORTANT**: This is not an official implementation of the Material Design system, and is not developed by Google.
